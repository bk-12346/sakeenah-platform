## 🧠 Overview  

Sakeenah is a conversational AI system designed to support structured self-reflection.  

Unlike traditional AI assistants that optimize for longer interactions, Sakeenah is intentionally constrained—encouraging users to pause, reflect, and disengage after meaningful interaction.  

The system combines **LLM orchestration, contextual memory, and behavioral constraints** to guide journaling in a focused and emotionally aware manner.

A key aspect of the system is its inspiration from **Tawakkul (trust and reliance)** and reflective themes derived from the **Names of Allah**, which inform the tone, structure, and intent of responses. This allows the system to provide **grounded, calming, and values-driven reflections** rather than generic AI-generated text.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy  

Most AI systems are optimized for:
- longer conversations  
- higher engagement  
- more usage  

Sakeenah is built around a different principle:

> **Reflection over engagement.**

Key design decisions:
- One structured reflection per day  
- Limited conversational depth (bounded interaction loops)  
- Context-aware responses instead of open-ended chat  
- Privacy-first data handling

## 🔑 Core Features  

- 📝 Guided journaling workflow  
- 🤖 Emotion-aware conversational responses  
- 🧠 Context-aware memory across sessions  
- 🔐 Authentication + anonymous → account migration  
- 📚 Persistent journal history  
- ⚠️ Safety-aware response handling for sensitive inputs  
- 🔁 Bounded interaction design (prevents infinite chat loops)  

---

## 🧠 Memory System  

Sakeenah implements a **multi-level memory design**:

### 1. Session Memory  
- Maintains context within a single journaling session  
- Enables coherent multi-turn interaction  

### 2. Historical Memory  
- Stores past journal entries  
- Provides continuity across sessions  

### 3. Emerging Feature — Reflective Memory (In Progress 🚧)  
- Aggregates journaling patterns over time (e.g., weekly trends)  
- Generates **contextual reflective insights**, such as:  
  > “I noticed you’ve been feeling anxious this week...”  
- Combines pattern recognition with structured response generation  
- Designed to integrate **emotional awareness + faith-based reassurance (Tawakkul-inspired responses)**  

→ This moves the system toward **longitudinal user understanding rather than isolated interactions**

## 🧩 LLM Pipeline  

The system is not a simple chatbot wrapper. It includes:

- Structured prompting layers  
- Context injection (session + history)  
- Response constraints (tone, intent, safety)  
- Controlled generation flow (bounded outputs)  

---

## ⚠️ Safety & Behavioral Constraints  

Sakeenah incorporates guardrails for sensitive interactions:

- Emotion-aware response shaping  
- Avoidance of harmful or escalating outputs  
- Encouragement of reflection rather than dependency  
- Controlled conversation limits  

---

## 🏗️ Engineering Challenges  

Key challenges addressed during development:

- Designing **bounded AI conversations** instead of infinite chat  
- Managing **contextual memory while preserving privacy**  
- Preventing **prompt drift across multiple turns**  
- Handling **emotionally sensitive inputs safely**  
- Building **stateful interactions over stateless LLM APIs**  
- Supporting **anonymous → authenticated user transitions**

## 🎯 Why This Project  

Sakeenah was built to explore a different paradigm for AI systems:  

> Systems that help users **stop**, rather than continue.  

It reflects a shift from:
- engagement-driven AI  
to  
- **intention-driven AI systems**
